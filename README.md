# libft Project

The libft project is a fundamental project in the curriculum of many programming courses. It involves creating your own library of useful functions in C.

## Purpose

The purpose of the libft project is to familiarize yourself with the C programming language and to gain a deeper understanding of how various standard library functions work.

## Contents

The libft library consists of various functions that can be used in C programs. These functions cover a wide range of functionalities, including string manipulation, memory allocation, linked list operations, and more.

## Usage

To use the libft library in your C project, you need to compile it into a static library file (`libft.a`). Once compiled, you can include the library in your C program by adding `#include "libft.h"` at the beginning of your source code file.

## Building the Library

To build the libft library, you can run the provided Makefile. The Makefile contains rules for compiling the library and generating the `libft.a` file.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on each function provided in the libft library, please refer to the [libft README.md](/Users/ayzahrao/Documents/libft/README.md) file.
